# TooManyCards (TMC)

**An overengineered Quizlet "replacement".**

So, uh, welcome to what has been my pet project for a month or so. If you came here
looking for a viable alternative to Quizlet, this is... not it. It's intended for only one
user: me! (and I have quite basic needs...)

Otherwise, enjoy my probably terrible code as TMC is also my chance to learn API design
and modern frontend development. ðŸŒº

## License

I don't know why you'd want to reuse this code, but the project is licensed under the
[Mozilla Public License 2.0](./LICENSE.txt) just in case. Licenses of "borrowed" code
[can be found in `LICENSE-THIRDPARTY.md`](./LICENSE-THIRDPARTY.md).

## Security

The short of it is "don't trust me, I don't know what I'm doing, mostly."

The long answer [can be found in `SECURITY.md`.](./SECURITY.md)

## To-do list

- Deck creation and edit routes
- PWA support
  - Basic offline support
- ~~Public decks~~
- More modes:
  - "Flashcard" mode
  - Test mode
  - Spaced repetition mode (depends on storing results)
- Result breakdown on deck completion
- Result storage (for "these are the terms that you need to work on the most")
- Reworked UI

Lower priority:

- GitHub (and potentially Google...?) Sign-on
- Private deck sharing (Ã  la Google Docs)
- Admin UI
- Markdown support
