# TooManyCards (TMC)

**An overengineered Quizlet "replacement".**

So, uh, welcome to what has been my pet project for a month or so. If you came here
looking for a viable alternative to Quizlet, this is... not it. It's intended for only one
user: me! (and I have quite basic needs...)

Otherwise, enjoy my probably terrible code as TMC is also my chance to learn API design
and modern frontend development. ðŸŒº

## Security

The short of it is "don't trust me, I don't know what I'm doing, mostly."

The long answer [can be found in `SECURITY.md`.](./SECURITY.md)

## API database (SQLite) schema

```sql

    "is_admin"         INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "created_at"       TEXT NOT NULL,

CREATE TABLE "decks" (
